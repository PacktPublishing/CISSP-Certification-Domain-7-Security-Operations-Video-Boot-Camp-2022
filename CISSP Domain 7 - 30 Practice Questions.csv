"In our data centers we have redundancy on many things. Looking at our servers, which of these elements are commonly NOT redundant?",multiple-choice,Hard disks.,Power supplies.,Motherboards.,Network cards.,,,3,"Motherboards are rarely redundant, instead we use redundant servers.

This approach requires large amounts of storage. Stop, look and listen: Each packet is analyzed in a basic way in memory and only certain information is saved for future analysis. This approach requires a faster processor to keep up with incoming traffic.",CBK 7: Security Operations

What could be a reason we would chose incremental backups over differential backups?,multiple-choice,Faster restores.,Faster backup time.,To exclude certain directories from the backup.,To include all directories in the backup.,,,2,"Incremental backups: Backs up everything that has changed since the last backup.

This can be taking a system off the network, isolating traffic, powering off the system, or however our plan dictates to isolate the system to minimize both the scope and severity of the incident. Knowing how to respond, when to follow the policies and procedures to the letter and when not to, is why we have senior staff handle the responses.
